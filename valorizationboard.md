This foundation aims to stimulate the development of the Netherlands as an information society, through creating the necessary economic, social and political preconditions in order to capitalise on the opportunities of ICT; remove threats associated with ICT and foster debate on the meaning of information technology for Dutch society. Aimed-for results include an improved general societal well-being, as well as the strengthening of the economic competitiveness of the Netherlands. The foundation’s primary instrument to reach these ends is through its status as an open, independent platform, where the following parties meet and exchange views in a pre-competitive setting: government administration; businesses (providers and end users of products and services; professional and trade associations) scientific, educational and research institutions; civil society; and politics. This platform enables stakeholders to initiate and conduct the necessary activities to realise the potential of the Netherlands as an information society. 

 Marjolijn is responsible for programs and projects in the field of Cyber Safety and Security, among which the Dutch Awareness Centre of the EU Better internet for Kids program. She is also one of the members of the Steering Committee of the Dutch Media Literacy Centre (mediawijzer.net) and Dutch delegation leader of the UN Internet Governance Forum (NLIGF). She is experienced in government relations and public private partnerships, university educated, pragmatical and has good communication skills.

I currently work at Stratix the leading telecom and digital economy consultancy of the Netherlands. In the past I worked for Tele2 as a regulatory affairs manager, the OECD in Paris as a senior policy advisor, Logica Managerment Consulting as a consultant and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs as a policy manager. I’ve worked with (international) governmental organisations, such as the European Union and Commission, BEREC, ITU and national telecom and media regulators 

Rudolfs biggest success so far has been to identify a necessary change to SIM-card regulation to support the Internet of Things. As a result of my policy analysis and subsequent lobbying, this is now part of the proposed European Electronic Communications Code, Dutch an Belgian telecom law and 2.4 million smart energy meters in the Netherlands already benefit from it. Another career success was initiating the first policy discussions on netneutrality in the Netherlands. 

Regularly Rudolf accepts invitations to speak at events (ITU, BEREC, IRG, IGF, IIC) and regularly he is interviewed or quoted by journalists (Economist, BBC, Ars Technica, GigaOM, Vox, Telegraaf) on issues such as the Internet of Things, security network neutrality, television, fixed and mobile competition and economics of the Internet.
