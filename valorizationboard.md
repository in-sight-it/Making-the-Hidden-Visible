<img style="float=left; margin-right: 1em;" align="left" margins=300px padding-right=100x src="/assets/small/Caroline.png"> **Caroline Nevejan** is a researcher and designer who has been involved with the emerging network society and digital culture since the 1980's. Nevejan is a regular presenter at national and international fora. She is an advisor to national and European policy makers.

Caroline Nevejan is professor by special appointment with the Amsterdam School for Social Science Research, University of Amsterdam (2018-2023). Her research is focused on Designing Urban Experience and she supervises 5 PhD candidates in this context. As of 20th of March 2017 Caroline Nevejan has been appointed Chief Science Officer of the city of Amsterdam. The Chief Science Officer orchestrates research between the municipality of Amsterdam and the different scientific, academic and artistic universities in the city. With a small team she makes sure that civil servants and researchers can find each other and invent different new ways of working together. 

Before Nevejan was associate professor with the Participatory Systems Initiative at Delft University of Technology. This relatively new group is part of the section Systems Engineering in the department of Multi Actor Systems at the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management. Nevejan's interdisciplinary research focuses on witnessed presence as a fundamental communication structure that defines how trust is built or breaks down. To this end she developed the YUTPA framework, which supports the analyses and design of trust in social, organisational and business contexts. Methodologically Nevejan focuses on artistic research and research though design. 

In 1994 Nevejan co-founded the Society for Old and New Media. The Waag Society, as it is known today, is an independent media lab and a knowledge center with a specific interest in the future of the public domain. Among many projects that Caroline Nevejan initiated at the Waag are The Reading Table for Old and New Media, which won the Rotterdam Design Prize 1997, Demi Dubbel, a curriculum game for 10 year olds, Internet in the Sky, a research project with Europe Online about the future of the internet, and Brandon, the first virtual piece of art acquired by the Guggenheim museum in New York. Working on these and similar projects she developed a cultural perspective on education. 

<img style="float=left; margin-right: 1em;" align="left" margins=300px padding-right=100x src="/assets/small/Marjolijn.png"> **Marjolijn Bonthuis** is program director at ECP. This foundation aims to stimulate the development of the Netherlands as an information society, through creating the necessary economic, social and political preconditions in order to capitalise on the opportunities of ICT; remove threats associated with ICT and foster debate on the meaning of information technology for Dutch society. Aimed-for results include an improved general societal well-being, as well as the strengthening of the economic competitiveness of the Netherlands. The foundation’s primary instrument to reach these ends is through its status as an open, independent platform, where the following parties meet and exchange views in a pre-competitive setting: government administration; businesses (providers and end users of products and services; professional and trade associations) scientific, educational and research institutions; civil society; and politics. This platform enables stakeholders to initiate and conduct the necessary activities to realise the potential of the Netherlands as an information society. 

 Marjolijn is responsible for programs and projects in the field of Cyber Safety and Security, among which the Dutch Awareness Centre of the EU Better internet for Kids program. She is also one of the members of the Steering Committee of the Dutch Media Literacy Centre (mediawijzer.net) and Dutch delegation leader of the UN Internet Governance Forum (NLIGF). She is experienced in government relations and public private partnerships, university educated, pragmatical and has good communication skills.

I’ve worked with (international) governmental organisations, such as the European Union and Commission, BEREC, ITU and national telecom and media regulators 

Rudolfs biggest success so far has been to identify a necessary change to SIM-card regulation to support the Internet of Things.

Another career success was initiating the first policy discussions on netneutrality in the Netherlands. 

Regularly Rudolf accepts invitations to speak at events (ITU, BEREC, IRG, IGF, IIC) and regularly he is interviewed or quoted by journalists (Economist, BBC, Ars Technica, GigaOM, Vox, Telegraaf) on issues such as the Internet of Things, security network neutrality, television, fixed and mobile competition and economics of the Internet.
