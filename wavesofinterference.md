#5G lab

This in an indepedent sub-project of IN-SIGHT.it in which Maxigas and Niels ten Oever seek to construct critical interpretative frames by analysing governance processes and implementations that make sense of the 5G phenomena and its infrastructural ecology.

The research currently has two approaches:

### Examinging social media platforms and website to identify interpetative frame of 5G
  Initial work on this has been done during the [Digital Methods Initiative Winterschool](https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/WinterSchool2021Infodemic5G)
    
### Construcing expirtimental 5G networks through a 5G lab

#### Equipment
#### Design
