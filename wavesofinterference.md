**Waves of Interference 5G lab**

This in an indepedent sub-project of IN-SIGHT.it in which Niels ten Oever, Maxigas, and Jeroen de Vos seek to construct critical interpretative frames by analysing governance processes and implementations that make sense of the 5G phenomena and its infrastructural ecology.

To provide this research project with a strong theoretical, technical, and social foundation, we have developed a [position paper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/in-sight-it/in-sight-it.github.io/gh-pages/assets/Peoples5GLabPostitionPaper.pdf). Comments on this position paper are very welcome, and we seek to update the document when new insights arise. Previous versions will be stored here as well.  

The research currently has two going parts:

**1. Examinging social media platforms and website to identify interpetative frames of 5G**
  
  Initial work on this has been done during the [Digital Methods Initiative Winterschool](https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/WinterSchool2021Infodemic5G)
    
**2. Constructing experimental 5G networks through a 5G lab**
  
  We aim to critically examine different network designs and affordances that become possible through the implementation 5G standards. 
  
  We aim to use our findings to make 5G technologies more insightful to a larger audience through visualizations and interactions that inform citizen engagement with standard setting, polticy making, and technology development.
  
## Current project:
  - [DONE] Get 4G LTE network working
  - [DONE] Get 5G network working
  - [DONE] Program SIM cards 
  - [DONE] Register software devices to network (UERANSIM)
    	- Short halt because of broken GPS DO - ordered new one from Ettus
  - [DONE] Install new GPS DO TCXO
  - [DONE] Get radio network working and register on the network  
	- Phones are not picking up radio network, might be cheap 4G antenna?  
	- Try with logarithmic antennae  
  	- Was not an issue with antennae but with a config in the dockers, was fixed with a git pull - always use updated software kids :)  
  	- Purchased new antennae from Ettus
  - [In Progress] Registration works until Osmohlr kicks us off the network, see: https://github.com/herlesupreeth/docker_open5gs/issues/74
  		- tried to make changes to oshmohlr.cfg
  			hlr
			 subscriber-create-on-demand 5 cs+ps
	          to no avail
  - [In Progress] Visualize 5G network traffic on laptop
  	- Weavescope & ctop & sysdig & sysdiginspect
  - [In Progress] Visualize 5G network traffic on LED cube
  	- New code (!) <https://github.com/agtoever/tcpdump2led/blob/master/tcpdump2led.py>
  - [Next] Run edge services in 5G network
  	- Ideally a service that uses precise geolocation and timing date from the network
  - [Next] Visualize edge services in 5G on laptop
  - [Next] Visualize edge services in 5G on laptop on LED cube
  - [Next] Use synth to add audio to visualization

### Tools
  - Soldering iron (Aoyue 3210)
  - Solder suction device
  - Soldering magnifying glass with LED
  - Multimeter
  - Laptop XPS13 w/ubuntu 20.04 LTS
  - Gaggia Classic Espresso Machine
 

### Software
  - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (as development platform (Debian doesn't support new laptop hardware, newer Ubuntu versions are not supported by all drivers, leading to significant issues with software dependencies when building everything from source). 
  - UHD (to talk to the B210: <https://github.com/EttusResearch/uhd>)
  - GNURadio (to experiment with the B210 and understand its concepts: <https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio>)
  - Open5Gs (excellently dockerized here: <https://github.com/herlesupreeth/docker_open5gs>)
  - Portainer (vizualise, inspect, and monitor dockers)
  - Weavescope & ctop & sysdig & sysdiginspect (to visualize traffic between containers)
  - Ledcube firmware (<https://github.com/yarivkeinan/8x8x8-led-cube-firmware>)
  - Ledcube serial access JTAG (<https://github.com/tomazas/ledcube8x8x8>)
  - Ledcube Java program to control LEDS (and Hex data stream standard) <https://github.com/tomazas/DotMatrixJava>
  - PySim (to read+write SIMcards: <https://github.com/osmocom/pysim>)  
  	- for PySim to run on Ubuntu 22.04 one needs to install pcscd and pcsc-tools and start the daemon:  
  		- $ sudo apt install pcscd pcsc-tools  
		- $ sudo service pcscd start  
	- Follow PySim installation instructions and $ python3 ./pySim-read.py -p0 (or -p1) should work  
	
### Config
  - Change the environment file (.env) in docker_open5gs
	  - MCC 204 #which is the code for NL
	  - MNC 42 #which is an unused operator number
	  - Card 1

### Hardware failure
  - Cheap hardware failure. Lesson learned: do not buy cheap hardware.
  - The ebay OCXO GPSDO failed after two months with:
		  	$ ./sync_to_gps

### Workshop outline
  - Ask people to communicate a complex standards over a distance without using their voice
  - Let people communicate using the semaphore flags standard
  - Introduce morse and show that was used in telegraph communications
  - Show by using led cube how a network transmits more signal
  - Show with led cube evolution of complexity from telegraph, to PSTN (circuit switching), GSM (mobility), 3G (data), 4G (everything over IP), 5G (more microservices and edge computing).
