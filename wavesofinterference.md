# Waves of Interference 5G lab

This in an indepedent sub-project of IN-SIGHT.it in which Maxigas, Niels ten Oever, and Jeroen de Vos seek to construct critical interpretative frames by analysing governance processes and implementations that make sense of the 5G phenomena and its infrastructural ecology.

The research currently has two approaches:

**1. Examinging social media platforms and website to identify interpetative frames of 5G**
  
  Initial work on this has been done during the [Digital Methods Initiative Winterschool](https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/WinterSchool2021Infodemic5G)
    
**2. Constructing experimental 5G networks through a 5G lab**
  
  We aim to critically examine different network designs and affordances that become possible through the implementation 5G standards. 
  
  Subsequently we aims to use our findings to make 5G more insightful to a larger audience.
  
## Current project:
  - [DONE] Get 4G LTE network working
  - [DONE] Get 5G network working
  - [In Progress] Program SIM cards to get range of devices registered to network
  - [In Progress] Visualize 5G network traffic on laptop
  - [In Progress] Visualize 5G network traffic on LED cube
  - [Next] Run edge services in 5G network
  - [Next] Visualize edge services in 5G on laptop
  - [Next] Visualize edge services in 5G on laptop on LED cube
  - [Next] Use synth to add audio to visualization
